		"Spinel17_PAGE_1": "IT DOESN'T LOOK THAT-",
		"Spinel17_PAGE_2": "Ok Mister Astro-NUT, I want to watch you try fishing. See the fishing rod beside me? That's a <![CDATA[<color=orange>fishing spot</color>]]>. Use the fishing spot and see what you can catch.",
		"Spinel17_PAGE_3": "However, before you cast your line you will need to find some <![CDATA[<color=orange>bait</color>]]>. Look around the Village and try to find something <![CDATA[<color=orange>edible</color>]]> that you think the fish will go for.",

		"Spinel19_PAGE_1": "What?! You caught ALL of the fish on Timber Hearth???",
		"Spinel19_PAGE_2": "Oh, you mean all of the different species. Not literally every fish on the planet. That makes more sense.",
		"Spinel19_PAGE_3": "Well, I'm impressed. You have shown your patience and persistence to catching and cataloguing all of these species. I appreciate it.",
		"Spinel19_PAGE_4": "If this mod wasn't a demo, I would give you another upgrade and tell you where to go next. But since it is, I think a more condensed and cliche phrase is in order...",
